                   <p>It is November 26, also known as the day before Black Friday. All jokes aside (apparently it is now Black Thursday/Friday/The whole fucking weekend now), it is Thanksgiving, or the day we Americans celebrate the good natured relationship between Native Americans and the mass murdering European settlers. I have no idea how this relationship of all things should be deserving of thanks, but I do really like the idea of thanking all the important people in my life, so here it is folks: Hari&rsquo;s Thanks Giving!!!</p>

                    <p>I want to thank my parents first and foremost, for putting up with all the shit that I do, and for always loving me unconditionally. You are amazing people, and I will always love you till the end of my days.</p>

                    <p>I want to thank my sisters for being amazing role models for me, and although you kinda have fucked me over in terms of expectations, I will always be proud of your numerous accomplishments and wish you both the best of luck for your future. God, I really hope you don&rsquo;t read this.</p>

                    <p>So now that the familial thanks are done, lets move on to the fun ones (rubs hands together) </p>

                    <p>I want to thank my three best friends (you know who you are), always the source of moral righteousness and good advice. I can&rsquo;t imagine where myself without the absolutely wonderful influences you guys have been on me. Oh shit, I actually can&#8230;. Sitting in Lazar, with the calc book open, actually paying attention to his claims</p>

                    <p>I want to thank my other best friend (you also know who you are) for always being there for me. Your bubbly personality truly brightens my day and I am always better off after having a conversation with you.   </p>

                    <p>I want to thank my other set of sisters and all my friends in college, who have actually given me great advice (not like the people two paragraphs up). The stories you tell me about college are hilarious, and I hope all of you ball out in college and grow up to be badasses.</p>

                    <p>I want to thank the girl I have feelings for. You have changed me, for the better or for the worse, I do not know, but this blog owes part of its existence to you, so thank you.</p>

                    <p>I want to thank my maths professor, the one and only Dr. Lazar, who has taught me to claim so well that no coupon is safe from me.</p>

                    <p>I want to thank my other APCS TAs, nah, just one in particular, for eliciting such strong emotional reactions from me and for being so mindful of people&rsquo;s feelings, except for a select few of my friends. Your constant non-judgmental judging is an amazing work of art, and the air of self-righteousness that you carry about you should be worshipped. (I am like vomiting in the back of my throat right now LOL)</p>

                    <p>I want to thank some of my wonderful colleagues for talking shit behind my back instead of in front of my face. They really do care about the skin on my knuckles, how kind of them.</p>

                    <p>And of course, I want to thank DECA for developing my deep understanding of the REAL business world, and for teaching me that back pain is caused by&#8230; wait, I still don&rsquo;t know what causes back pain wtf. Also, thank you for introducing me to the group of people who refer to themselves as &ldquo;only business majors&rdquo;, and who , not coincidentally, are all dipshits.</p>

                    <p> I want to thank the GOP and Fox News, for always being there to cheer me up, even when I am very down and depressed.</p>

                    <p>I want to thank the Golden State Warriors for continuing to polish LeBron&rsquo;s NBA Finals record, and for being awesome in general.</p>

                    <p>I want to thank the idiotic, I mean wonderful Indianapolis Colts for giving the Patriots more bulletin board material on their romp to a fifth Super Bowl. </p>

                    <p>And I must not forget, I must thank my girl Amy Xu for giving me another family, bonded together by the only thing thicker than blood, hate. (I am intentionally spelling this name incorrectly)</p>

                    <p>So that concludes my Thanks Giving. Please forgive me if I have not included you in the list above, I love you just as much, I just couldn&rsquo;t think of any description that wouldn&rsquo;t disappoint you. So thanks once again to everybody, and I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving! </p>
