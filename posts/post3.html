        <div class="container">

                    <p>So I just finished reading the Iliad by Homer for AP English. I basically spent 2 months skimming through the book to make sure I got random details, and studying sparknotes and gradesaver for plot. But yesterday night, for the first time, I started to read the Iliad, and it absolutely blew my mind. I am a big fan of Lord of the Rings, the Inheritance Trilogy, and fantasy stories of the same magnitude. But man, the Iliad is just on another level. The characters are just so varied and complex, and the story is just soooo epic. Following the epic tale of the war and its happenings has inspired me to try my hand at writing in the style of the great poet (if he/they are even real, fucking Homeric Question arghhh). Let&rsquo;s hope that my own version is not really shitty, lest Achilles rage upon me. </p>
                   <br>
                    <h2>Book 1- Beginnings</h2>
                <div class="poem">
                    <p>Fury, the vengeful fury of Hari the unknown, the fury that  raged within his skinny chest as he screamed to the heavens while typing on his computer, trying to recount the story of his life on his applications. No, not the song  sung by the group of adolescents known as  One Direction, but the epic tale that encompassed the  17 year journey that defined his existence on this world.</p>

                    <p>On the 28th of March, that fateful day, nothing of great importance  occurred, yet as the Fates had decreed, on the next morn, A babe was born, its wrinkled body emitting a scream shrill louder  than a Mad horse, while beating at its bare chest. The long-haired mother gazed down at the babe and laughed, a beautiful laugh that made the birds flutter up to the  window of the strong hospital, home of the sick and weak. </p>

                    <p>For a boy had been born, a boon from the great Hera, patron of  the family, and wife to Zeus the mighty. The elder sister Lakshmi,  she of the bright face and brilliant smile, yelled with delight &ldquo;Long-haired  Mother, delighted as I am to welcome such a brother to this  illustrious family and world, I hope he does not bear the burden of being the youngest child, but rather grows up to be a man of his own.&rdquo; And thus his fate was decreed, the boy would live with the weight of  his family upon him, as he tried to make a name for himself in the world.</p>

                    <p> (Lets just skip the entirety of my childhood and go to high school)</p>

                    <p> And so the boy grew, both in body and in mind, although the growth mainly was in the length of his limbs and not the girth. He entered the second phase of training in his life, with great  expectations and excitement. Expectations to surpass his elder sisters, they of the intelligent minds and legendary accomplishments.  In his mind, oh that narrow mind, they were his heroes and idols,  people to be admired, not lived up to. He, like the great Achilles  learned, knew that mere mortals could not stand up to the  might of the gods. </p>

                    <p>Excitement, for in his heart, he desired to prove to his illustrious  family and more importantly to himself, that he indeed was  worthy of being of the same blood as the mighty Subbaraj&rsquo;s.</p>

                    <p>And so Hari the unknown began his mission.  He tore through the pages in his textbooks, disfiguring the  pages with a never ending onslaught. Countless  notebooks and paper were defied by the pen and the pencil, created by the being known as Ticonderoga. Hordes and hordes of essays, labs, and tests from all over the world  were vanquished with ease and even delight. Hari the unknown was well on his way to writing his own legend, or so he thought.</p>

                    <p>Wyrd is a fickle beast however, and it laughs in the face of  people who think it easily defeated. And so, something  unexpected happened to Hari the unknown that would change  him forever: he fell in <strong>love</strong>. </p>

                    <h3>End of Book 1</h3>
                </div>

                    <p>Sorry for ending there, I need to really think about the next part before I put it on the blog, I want it to be meaningful haha. Hopefully this wasn&rsquo;t too bad, I didn&rsquo;t think writing like this would be as difficult as it was, but I had a good time doing it. Also, everything recounted in this poem (thing? Not really sure what this is LOL) is 100% true. Except maybe my sister&rsquo;s dialogue haha. My original post was about something completely different, but I just had to get this down on paper before I lost that inspiration.</p>

                    <p>Anyways, credits to Homer for being a complete badass in terms of writing, and I will see you all next time with <strong>Book 2 &ndash; The Fall of Hari</strong>. Thank you all so much, and let me know how it was!!</p>

                    <p>Here's an image I made LOL :</p>
