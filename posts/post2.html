                    <p>You know that feeling when you try really really hard at something, like I mean put all your effort (or in my case, about a quarter of the effort I am capable of), and you still fail miserably? It truly is a horrible feeling. It&rsquo;s the feeling I get after a multivariable test, or what the Dolphins feel like after getting crushed by the Pats. I digress, lets get back to the point. That feeling of helplessness is a somewhat common event in my life, but there is one time that it can never fail to well up in my mind- when I hit the scales. </p>

                    <p>My friends describe me as a pretty thin guy. Never mind that&rsquo;s complete bullshit. The only reason they don&rsquo;t crack skeleton jokes all the time is because one of my best friends is skinnier than I am, looking at you Nihal. I weight about 123 lbs., or for those smart non &lsquo;Murican people who use the metric system, 55.79 kg. That may seem like a decent weight, but for a guy that&rsquo;s 6&rsquo;1&rsquo;&rsquo;, well let&rsquo;s just say that it&rsquo;s very hard to find me on that BMI chart. The weird thing is, I don&rsquo;t see myself as overly skinny. I am relatively fit (or I like to think so) and I eat a lot, it&rsquo;s just that I simply cannot gain weight. I know at this point that you are super skeptical, I mean, just eat a lot of junk food and you&rsquo;ll start to balloon. The problem is, I&rsquo;m just not a junk food guy, and it&rsquo;s not because of my parents either. In fact, when my parents were out of the country for 10 days, I could&rsquo;ve eaten anything and everything. Instead, I ended up finishing all the fruits in my house, along with the occasional chapathi and curry. The two times I went out to eat, I got a salad and chocolate milk from Safeway. Unfortunately, that pigging out gained me all of -3 pounds. </p>

                    <p> To find the reason of why I couldn&rsquo;t gain weight, I tried to analyze why exactly I wasn&rsquo;t making any gains. After several hours of careful introspection, I realized that I really do not like eating. The though of putting stuff in my mouth, swallowing, and eventually shitting it out just doesn&rsquo;t really really sound like an amazing thing to me. Yea, some food tastes great, but I don&rsquo;t eat for taste. I really only eat when I am hungry, and while I do appreciate good food, I am not overly picky when I eat, which is crazy, cause my mom is a chef of the highest caliber. I guess I like being skinny, but I definitely want to make some changes. But as the saying goes, life is always greener on the other side</p>

                    <p>And so, I have made a life-changing decision. I am going to try my hardest to become fat. Why eat celery sticks when you can have French fries? I&rsquo;ll toss that bowl of grapes for that oh so buttery popcorn. You name it, I will eat it. To start off, I asked my mom to buy a box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates, and after consuming about half the box in two days, I have to say, this junk food thing may be growing on me. </p>

                    <p>Note: this is probably the worst possible way for me to gain weight. I should be hitting that gym and getting swole, but I am kinda lazy haha. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the post, I stopped writing for a long time while doing apps and school work, so it didn&rsquo;t come out the way I expected it to, but it was definitely interesting to write. Also, don&rsquo;t forget to check out the third post, which you can find here and on the front page! Thank you so much for reading this, and I love you guys. </p>
