                    <p>I have a notoriously short attention span. As my mother never fails to point out, I cannot think about or work on an activity for more than a few hours, whether it is academics or even something that interests me.</p>

                    <p>So why then, am I writing a blog? On the surface, it seems exactly like the activity that I hate: something that is time consuming and requires incredible focus. The idea came to me over the weekend, in three separate stages that culminated in a triumphant yet silent first pump (It was 2 in the morning, couldn&rsquo;t wake up my parents) as I pushed this blog template onto Github Pages. So thank you to whomever is reading this, and please bear with me as I try to prove to myself that I am not a crappy writer. </p>

                    <p>Show and tell was my favorite game in elementary school. I loved listening to other people&#8230; eh who am I kidding; I loved &ldquo;watch me show and tell&rdquo;. I could bring anything that I wanted and show my friends, anything, as long as it wasn&rsquo;t dangerous, inappropriate, religious, indicative of violence&#8230; I think you get the gist of this. To revise the previous statement, I could bring anything that I wanted to as long as I was allowed to bring it. So in essence, we were supposed to bring an object to class that told our classmates that we were normal kids with normal lives. </p>

                    <p>So maybe I am being harsh, after all, these are six year olds that we are talking about. So fast forward 11 years and here I am, writing essays to show (not tell, as Ms. Lindsey has drilled into my head) colleges who I am. But as I draft more and more essays, I realize that I am not showing these colleges who I am, but rather a carefully constructed, but undoubtedly fake version of me. I hope other people find this as ironic as I do: I am still playing the same game of show and tell that I was 11 years earlier. </p>

                    <p>So that&rsquo;s what this blog is all about: to put my true self out there, without any censorship whatsoever, to express my opinions without fear of hate or rejection, to open myself up to the world. I truly believe that if I can handle this introspection, something I&rsquo;ve never done before, I will learn more about myself and be content with who I am as a person. So lets begin show and tell, version 2: No holds barred (for those of you who aren&rsquo;t into wrestling, it means no rules apply).</p>

                    <p>And on that note, I have a small confession to make: no matter how well you think you know me, you don&rsquo;t. I mean that not in a hurtful manner, but as a fact. I have hid parts of myself from the people I know and love, and it is definitely time to stop doing that. Hopefully this blog is the first step in that direction. Sorry for being so serious in this post, I am usually not this emotional or deep. I just thought it would be nice if you as readers knew my motivations behind this blog and why I randomly started it. Thank you once again for reading this, and I&rsquo;m very excited to see where this goes!!!</p>



                    <p>Last thing: if I could bring something for show and tell, it would be my fucking Common App essay, cause I really need to get that shit edited :O. Let me know what you folks would bring in the comments!
                    Note: Comments not yet up, will be very soon </p>
